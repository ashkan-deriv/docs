# Account API Endpoints Reference

## Overview

The **Account** category encompasses endpoints for account authentication, balance monitoring, and accessing account history. These endpoints enable you to:

- Authenticate your WebSocket connection with API tokens
- Exchange one-time tokens for long-lived session tokens
- Monitor account balance in real-time
- View detailed transaction history (statements)
- Analyze profit and loss across all contracts
- Manage your portfolio of open positions

These endpoints are essential for account management, financial tracking, and building comprehensive trading dashboards.

## API Endpoints Summary

| API Call Name | Description | Authentication | Scopes | Subscription Support | Primary Function |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| [`authorize`](../endpoints/authorize.md) | Authorize WebSocket connection with an API token | No* | - | No | Authentication |
| [`get_session_token`](../endpoints/get_session_token.md) | Exchange one-time token for long-lived session token | No | - | No | Authentication |
| [`balance`](../endpoints/balance.md) | Get current account balance | Yes | trade | Yes | Balance Monitoring |
| [`statement`](../endpoints/statement.md) | Retrieve account transaction history | Yes | trade | No | Transaction History |
| [`profit_table`](../endpoints/profit_table.md) | Retrieve profit/loss summary for closed contracts | Yes | trade | No | Profit/Loss Analysis |
| [`portfolio`](../endpoints/portfolio.md) | View all currently open positions | Yes | trade | No | Portfolio Management |

**Note**: `authorize` doesn't require prior authentication but does require a valid API token in the request.

## Additional Information

### Authentication Flow

**Standard Flow (API Token)**:
1. Call `authorize` with your API token
2. Connection is now authenticated for subsequent requests
3. All privileged endpoints become accessible

**Session Token Flow (Brand Integration)**:
1. Receive a one-time token from the brand
2. Call `get_session_token` to exchange it for a session token
3. Use the session token with `authorize` for authentication
4. Session token is long-lived and reusable

### Balance Monitoring

The `balance` endpoint:
- Returns current account balance and currency
- Supports real-time subscription for balance updates
- Updates automatically after transactions (buy, sell, deposits, withdrawals)
- Essential for displaying current buying power

**Subscription Usage**:
```json
{
  "balance": 1,
  "subscribe": 1
}
```

### Transaction History vs Profit Table

**Statement (`statement`)**:
- Shows ALL account transactions
- Includes: buys, sells, deposits, withdrawals, fees
- Filterable by date range and transaction type
- Provides complete audit trail
- Shows balance after each transaction

**Profit Table (`profit_table`)**:
- Shows ONLY closed contracts
- Focuses on trading performance
- Displays buy price, sell price, and profit/loss
- Filterable by contract type and date range
- Ideal for P&L reporting

### Portfolio Management

The `portfolio` endpoint:
- Lists all currently OPEN positions
- Provides contract IDs needed for other operations
- Shows current P&L for each position
- Essential for risk management dashboards
- Contract IDs used with `proposal_open_contract` for detailed monitoring

### Common Use Cases

**Trading Dashboard**:
- `balance` (subscribed) - Real-time balance display
- `portfolio` - List of open positions
- `proposal_open_contract` - Detailed view of selected position

**Account History**:
- `statement` - Complete transaction log
- `profit_table` - Trading performance summary

**Risk Management**:
- `portfolio` - Monitor all open positions
- `balance` - Track available funds
- `statement` - Verify all account activity

### Filtering and Pagination

Most history endpoints support:
- **Date Filtering**: `date_from` and `date_to` parameters
- **Pagination**: `limit` and `offset` parameters
- **Type Filtering**: Filter by contract type or action type
- **Description Detail**: Optional detailed contract descriptions

### Scopes and Permissions

All authenticated account endpoints require the **trade** scope. Ensure your API token has the necessary permissions:
- **Read**: View balance, statements, portfolio
- **Trade**: Required for actual trading operations

API tokens can be created in the account settings with specific scopes assigned.

### Best Practices

1. **Authentication**: Always call `authorize` first before making authenticated requests
2. **Balance Monitoring**: Subscribe to balance updates rather than polling
3. **Error Handling**: Check for authentication errors and token expiration
4. **Data Caching**: Cache statement and profit table data locally to reduce API calls
5. **Security**: Never expose API tokens in client-side code; use backend proxies
6. **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate API tokens for security
