# Data API Endpoints Reference

## Overview

The **Data** category provides endpoints for retrieving market data and symbol information. These endpoints are fundamental for:

- Discovering available trading symbols and markets
- Understanding contract specifications and trading conditions
- Accessing real-time price feeds
- Retrieving historical price data for technical analysis
- Building charts and performing market analysis

These endpoints are typically the first calls made in a trading application, as they provide the foundation for understanding what can be traded and how to access price information.

## API Endpoints Summary

| API Call Name | Description | Authentication | Subscription Support | Data Type | Key Use Case |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|--------------|
| [`active_symbols`](../endpoints/active_symbols.md) | Retrieve list of all currently active symbols | No | No | Symbols | Get available trading instruments and their properties |
| [`contracts_for`](../endpoints/contracts_for.md) | Get list of available contracts and trading conditions for a symbol | No | No | Contract Specifications | Understand what contract types are available for a symbol |
| [`ticks`](../endpoints/ticks.md) | Initiate continuous stream of spot price updates | No | Yes | Real-time Ticks | Stream live price updates for market data feeds |
| [`ticks_history`](../endpoints/ticks_history.md) | Get historic tick data for a given symbol | No | Yes (optional) | Historical Data | Retrieve historical prices for charting and analysis |

## Additional Information

### No Authentication Required

All data endpoints can be accessed without authentication, making them ideal for:
- Public market data displays
- Unauthenticated users browsing available markets
- Building informational tools and price charts

### Symbol Information

Use `active_symbols` to discover:
- Available trading symbols
- Market categories (forex, indices, commodities, synthetic indices)
- Whether markets are currently open
- Trading suspension status
- Display properties for UI rendering

### Contract Information

The `contracts_for` endpoint provides detailed information about:
- Available contract types for each symbol
- Barrier limitations and durations
- Minimum and maximum stakes
- Payout limits
- Market and submarket categorization

### Real-time vs Historical Data

**Real-time Data (`ticks`)**:
- Provides continuous streaming updates
- Ideal for live price displays
- Lower latency
- Updates on every tick

**Historical Data (`ticks_history`)**:
- Retrieves past price data
- Supports both tick and candle (OHLC) formats
- Configurable time ranges and granularity
- Can optionally subscribe for ongoing updates
- Perfect for charting and technical analysis

### Typical Data Flow

1. **Discovery**: Call `active_symbols` to see what's available
2. **Specification**: Call `contracts_for` to understand trading conditions
3. **Current Prices**: Subscribe to `ticks` for real-time updates
4. **Historical Analysis**: Call `ticks_history` for charting and backtesting

### Performance Considerations

- Use `active_symbols` with `brief` parameter for faster responses with essential fields only
- For `ticks_history`, specify appropriate time ranges to avoid large data transfers
- Consider caching `active_symbols` and `contracts_for` data as they don't change frequently
- Use candles instead of ticks for historical data when possible to reduce data volume

### Subscription Management

When subscribing to `ticks` or `ticks_history`:
- Each subscription returns a unique `id` in the response
- Use this `id` with [`forget`](../endpoints/forget.md) to cancel specific subscriptions
- Use [`forget_all`](../endpoints/forget_all.md) with `"ticks"` to cancel all tick subscriptions at once
