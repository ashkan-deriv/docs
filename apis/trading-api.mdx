# Trading API Endpoints Reference

## Overview

The **Trading** category contains all endpoints related to the complete contract lifecycle management. These endpoints enable you to:

- Get real-time price proposals for various contract types
- Purchase and sell contracts
- Monitor open positions with live updates
- Update contract parameters (stop loss, take profit)
- Cancel contracts with cancellation features
- Track transaction history in real-time
- Manage WebSocket subscriptions for streaming data

This category is essential for building trading applications, allowing full control over contract trading from proposal to settlement.

## Additional Information

### Authentication & Scopes

Most trading operations require authentication with the **trade** scope. You must call the [`authorize`](../endpoints/authorize.md) endpoint first with a valid API token that has trading permissions.

### Subscription Pattern

Many endpoints support real-time subscriptions by setting `subscribe: 1` in the request. These include:
- `proposal` - Stream price updates
- `buy` - Stream contract updates after purchase  
- `proposal_open_contract` - Stream open contract updates
- `transaction` - Stream all transaction events

To cancel subscriptions, use `forget` (for specific stream ID) or `forget_all` (for stream type).

### Typical Trading Flow

1. **Get Pricing**: Call `proposal` to get contract price
2. **Purchase**: Use the proposal ID with `buy` to purchase
3. **Monitor**: Use `proposal_open_contract` to track your position
4. **Manage Risk**: Use `contract_update` to set/modify stop loss or take profit
5. **Close**: Use `sell` to close the position or `cancel` if cancellation is available

### Error Handling

All endpoints return standardized error responses. Common errors include:
- Invalid contract parameters
- Insufficient balance
- Contract no longer available
- Authentication failures

Refer to individual endpoint documentation for specific error codes and handling.
